# [Ambika Dubey] J124: Final Project

## Story summary and sourcing

### Summary
The wildfires dataset can serve as the basis for a story on natural disaster preparedness per county in California. Combined with a dataset of the population of California cities and counties (see "Additional resources" below), we should be able to estimate the number of people affected by a wildfire in a given county. In addition, for further analysis we could combine analysis of the wildfire dataset (size/scope/severity over time) with a temperature or climate events dataset (see "Additional resources" below) to illustrate a correlation between the two. For example, we could explore whether drought years make for worse wildfires, or if the causes of the fires differ between draught years and otherwise.

### Additional resources
- [Dataset] Daily temperature in major cities [(via Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities).
     - Joined with the wildfires dataset, this temperature dataset could help illustrate a correlation between temperature and prevalence of wildfires in California cities or counties.
- [Dataset] California cities dataset [(via Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-feature-engineering?select=cal_populations_county.csv)
    - Joined with the wildfires dataset and the temperature dataset, this dataset gives us the ability to do more nuanced reporting on the number of people affected by a fire in a given county or city.

### Questions and answers from this dataset
1. Which was California's deadliest wildfire between 2013 and 2019?
    * Butte County's Camp Fire in 2018 was the deadliest fire in this time period, resulting in 85 total fatalities.
    * Method: Sort original dataset by "Fatalities" descending, take the first one.
3. Which of the wildfires in this period has the highest number of personnel involved?
    * River Fire (Mendocino Complex), which affected Mendocino, Lake, and Colusa Counties in 2018, had the highest number of personnel involved at 3,100.
    * Method: Sort original dataset by "PersonnelInvolved" descending, take the first one.
5. Which five counties were affected by the most number of fires between 2013 and 2019?
